Tabulation Recipe

If you tabulate, youll have an optimized solution off the bat

- visualize the problem as a table
- size the table based on the inputs
- initialize the table with default values
- seed the trivial answer into the table
- iterate through the table (the hard part, design logic that fills the table based on the problem)
- fill further positions based on the current position
