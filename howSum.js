// Write a function howSum(targetSum, numbers) that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments
// The function should retuen an array containing any combination of elements that add up to exactly the targetSum/ If there is no combination that adds up to the targetSum, then return null.
// if there are mutiple combinations possible, you may return any single one. 

// howSum (7, [5,3,4,7]) -> true
// howSum (8, [2,3,5]) -> 2+2+2, 3+5 
// howSum(0, [2,3,4]) -> []

const howSum = (targetSum, number) =>{
